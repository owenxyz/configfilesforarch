hello, i'm owen and i'm a secondary school student :) i won't post much here, maybe some config files and shit etc
anyways i hope you like these!

most of this stuff comes standard on the archcraft iso ( if you want the link here it is: https://archcraft.io/download.html )
i've tweaked some of it to match my personal preferences. if you want to install any of it please don't come to me for tips :)

also please make sure that if you are going to use any of these configs, that you actually have the programs installed.

my alacritty and .zshrc files use these dependancies:
 - pokemon colorscripts (https://github.com/nuke-dash/pokemon-colorscripts-mac) it does work on linux aswell
 - oh-my-zsh (https://ohmyz.sh)
 - and of course the zsh shell (sudo pacman -S zsh and then chsh /bin/zsh)

please read through my .zshrc file if your planning on using it, as it has some nice aliases that you can use.

also, i will sometimes forget to update my configs so please be patient with me!
