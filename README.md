hello, i'm owen and i'm a secondary school student :) i won't post much here, maybe some config files and shit etc
anyways i hope you like these!

most of this stuff comes standard on the archcraft iso ( if you want the link here it is: https://archcraft.io/download.html )
i've tweaked some of it to match my personal preferences. if you want to install any of it please don't come to me for tips :)
